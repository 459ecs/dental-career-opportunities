   - **Your short-term and long-term personal and professional goals.**
   - **Why you believe you are a strong candidate for this position.**
   - **Any other information that will help us understand your motivations and aspirations to apply for this position.**

## Assessment Requirements

## Important Note About Assessment Report
REMEMBER to share the URL link to your complete assessment report that includes:

DO NOT SHARE the certificate or final score - we need the URL link to review your detailed speaking performance across all evaluation matrices.

**Correct Report Link Format:**  
You can copy the link from the browser address bar when you're on the assessment report page. Your shared link should look like this:  
`https://app.smalltalk2.me/shared/cub84o4b60ag0i2e2v71`, where the `cub84o4b60ag0i2e2v71` part is a unique report ID string, with the rest of the URL mixed in SmallTalk2Me's tracking parameters, which is not needed for the assessment report but you can include them as the whole URL to share with us any way you like as long as the prior part with the unique report ID string is present.
