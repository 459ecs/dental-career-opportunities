    populations. Partner with local community centers and organizations
    to reach those in need.

### 2. **Underserved Populations**

-   **Cultural Competence Training**: Develop and provide cultural
    competence training for dental professionals to better serve diverse
    populations, including Aboriginal people, official language
    minorities, immigrants, and refugees.
-   **Mobile Dental Units**: Deploy mobile dental units to reach
    geographically isolated and underserved communities. These units can
    provide essential dental services and education to populations that
    otherwise have limited access.
-   **Partnerships with Community Organizations**: Collaborate with
    community organizations that serve underserved populations to
    provide dental care and education. This can include partnerships
    with Indigenous health organizations, immigrant and refugee support
    groups, and disability advocacy organizations.

### 3. **Government Initiatives**

-   **Leverage Government Funding**: Align your project with the
    Canadian Dental Care Plan by ensuring that your services are
    accessible to uninsured Canadians with annual family incomes under
    \$90,000. Highlight how your project complements government efforts
    to expand dental coverage.
-   **Public Awareness Campaigns**: Launch public awareness campaigns to
    inform eligible populations about the new Canadian Dental Care Plan
    and how they can access dental services through your project. Use
    multiple languages and culturally relevant materials to reach
    diverse communities.

### 4. **Rural vs. Urban Disparities**

-   **Tele-Dentistry Services**: Implement tele-dentistry services to
    provide remote consultations and follow-up care for patients in
    rural and remote areas. This can help bridge the gap between urban
    and rural dental care availability.
-   **Incentives for Rural Dentists**: Create incentive programs to
    attract and retain dental professionals in rural areas. This can
    include offering loan repayment assistance, housing subsidies, and
    professional development opportunities.
-   **Rural Health Collaborations**: Partner with rural health clinics
    and hospitals to integrate dental services into their existing
    healthcare offerings. This can help provide comprehensive care to
    rural populations and reduce untreated dental conditions.

### Additional Creative Ideas

#### 1. **School-Based Dental Programs**

-   **Oral Health Education in Schools**: Develop and implement oral
    health education programs in schools, particularly in low-income and
    rural areas. This can include regular dental check-ups, fluoride
    treatments, and educational workshops.
-   **School Dental Clinics**: Establish dental clinics within schools
    to provide convenient access to dental care for children. This can
    help address dental issues early and promote lifelong oral health
    habits.

#### 2. **Workplace Dental Programs**

-   **On-Site Dental Services**: Partner with large employers,
    especially in low-income and rural areas, to provide on-site dental
    services for employees. This can improve access to care and reduce
    time off work for dental appointments.
-   **Employee Dental Benefits**: Work with employers to enhance dental
    benefits for employees, particularly those in low-wage jobs. This
    can help reduce financial barriers to accessing dental care.

#### 3. **Community Health Worker Programs**

-   **Training Community Health Workers**: Train community health
    workers to provide basic oral health education, screenings, and
    referrals. This can extend the reach of dental services and promote
    preventive care in underserved communities.
-   **Peer Educator Programs**: Develop peer educator programs where
    community members are trained to educate their peers about oral
    health and available dental services. This can help build trust and
    increase engagement in underserved populations.

### Conclusion

By integrating these low-hanging-fruit ideas into your application, you
can demonstrate a comprehensive and innovative approach to addressing
dental care disparities in Canada. These strategies not only enhance the
eligibility of your project but also ensure that it aligns with
government initiatives and effectively reaches underserved populations.
This approach will make your proposal more compelling and increase the
likelihood of securing funding and support from the Oral Health Access
Fund.
